# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Week-4-Project


This repository contains my submission for Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The goal is to demonstrate the ability to collect, process dan clean a data set. 

A full description of the data used can be found at 'The UCI Machine Learning Repository'(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

This project data source can be downloaded from this link (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

This repository contains :

1. R script 'run_analysis.R' which perform the following :
      a. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
      b. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      d. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
      e. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. 'CODEBOOK.md' that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

3. 'TidyData.txt' is the output from the 'run_analysis.R' R script
